# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
    We all have busy work days and a little order is necessary. That's what this project was for. You can use it to plan your work day from 9am-5pm. The grey color are the events that has past, the red is the current event, and green is future events.

## Installations

## Usage
    1. Put the event on the time you want it to be and click click the save button. 
    
    2. When you click the save button, a message will appear that it is saved to local storage. It will save for you even after you refresh the page.
    
    3. To change event, simply delete the old one and put a new one in.
